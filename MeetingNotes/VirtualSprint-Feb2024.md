# Goals
- Give nonprofit organizations clearer  community-sourced “Well Architected” type org lifecycle guidance that is up-to-date, practical, and accessible regardless of their capacity to buy tools, or hire technical staff or consultants
- Provide a framework for regular review and updates of guidance that is easy for busy volunteers to manage
- Tasks this Sprint:
    - Divide up and write up starting content to feed the site (bare bones is great - have to start somewhere)… see notes on the idea structure we started at last Sprint and expanded on before the holiday break: https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/deployment-best-practices/MeetingNotes/2023-11-15/
    - Better set up theme and site for those who can figure this stuff out - this is only this far thanks to some help from Jodie and Thad but even without those changes, I can tell you it’s really easy to update via VSCode in simple Markdown files and I can demo tomorrow for those who are willing.
