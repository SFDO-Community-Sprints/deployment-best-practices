Talking about the One Pager  
Sprint Cadence came up, specifically a release cycle and “Feature Flags”

* Feature Flag \- Allows you to deploy code in such a way that you can deploy a feature, piece mill and only allow certain users to access it and so on

When is it ok to make a change in production?

How to document changes \- various tools and methods, pluses and drawbacks

* Jira  
* Elements  
* Custom Object to document  
* Cases

Created folder to host example templates for configuration tracking documents: [Configuration Tracker Documentation Examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14jJnM30xnRolzL9xvc6OE7ISEgFlyr6R?usp=sharing)

# Day 2 09/27/2024

## Participants  
* Judi Sohn  
* Heath Parks  
* Suraj Varma  
* Jordyn Jaffer  
* John Sim

* Quick recap of what was accomplished for day one and then went into reviewing the documents that were started yesterday.

* Decision was made to create a one pager introduction document that outlined some key principles and included keys and a glossary of terms, that could be referenced throughout the rest of the documentation.  
* Decision was made to not put 3rd party solutions into the guides, as free solutions may not stay free and not all orgs can afford paid solutions.  We did add verbiage on the one pager to note that there are 3rd party solutions that people can explore, when/if it's appropriate.  
* Removed this portion from Build Phase best practices as it’s more of an advanced process and is may be better in the advanced best practices guide


Apex Coding Best Practice

* Proper naming conventions   
* Descriptive variables and class names.  
* Bulkify where possible   
* Reference order of execution.   
* Utilize proper Trigger framework.  
* Avoid executing SOQL queries in loops


## Accomplishments - Solo Admin Scenario

* Finished  the Environment Selection Guide document   
* Finished the Testing Before Deployment guide  
* The other 3 documents are close to being finished and should be completed before the next Sprint or during the next Sprint for sure.  
* Will then start on the actual deployment guide during the Chicago Sprint  
* Judi will add the 2 docs we finished to Git pages.  
* Also created a Welcome Guide to provide additional details and glossaries.
