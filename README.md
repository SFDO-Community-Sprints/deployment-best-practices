# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
Bring the [Salesforce Well-Architected Framework](https://architect.salesforce.com/well-architected/overview) from Manifesto of Best Practice to action by building out documentation and step by step guides that are approachable to implement for nonprofit organizations and the partners that love them. Utilizing the rich leading-edge history of the SFDO Community and ongoing innovation of [CCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)/[Snowfakery](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit) and other **affordable** tooling we aim to provide guides, best practices and influence direction.
