# deployment-best-practices

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
Bring the Well Architected Framework from Manifesto of Best Practice to action by building out documentation and step by step guides that are approachable to implement for nonprofit organizations and the partners that love them. Utilizing the rich leading-edge history of the SFDO Community and ongoing innovation of CCI/Snowfakery and tooling built on it like D2X, build out documentation and step by step guides that are approachable to implement for nonprofit organizations and the partners that love them. Over 2 days weâ€™l frame and scope the challenge, map processes typical in a smaller organization/consulting firm, and build a strategy towards solutions that empower individuals to confidently lead and influence a shift to source-driven best practices.
