# Salesforce Deployment Best Practices Working Group

This wiki will serve as the central collection point for notes and next steps for the "Deployment Best Practices" Commons Group, first started  at the Chicago Community Sprint in October 2023. 

Nonprofit organization Salesforce administrators have a lot to manage, often without a lot of training and experience. Sandboxes, environments, scratch orgs, sf CLI, DevOps Center... it's overwhelming and difficult to know where to start. This project aims to take the concepts of the [Salesforce Well-Architected Framework](https://architect.salesforce.com/well-architected/overview) and translate them to resources and tools to make them more accessible and actionable for administrators and the consultants who work with them.

Want to contribute? Review the notes from our conversations so far and look for updates early in 2024.
